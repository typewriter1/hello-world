# Pi calculation
Run pi.py to calculate pi. Leave it running to get more accurate results.

# How it Works
Repeatedly selects random points in a one-by-one square. There is a one-quarter pi chance that this point will be less than 0.5 in distance from the origin, so by multiplying the fraction of points whithin 0.5 from the origin by 4, an increasingly close value of pi is found.
